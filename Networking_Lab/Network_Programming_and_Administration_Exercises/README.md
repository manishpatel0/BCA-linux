## List of TCP/IP Ports
*[  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) specifies TCP/IP port numbers.
As we discussed earlier in the course, all the port numbers are divided into three
categories based on port number ranges: the Well Known Ports, the Registered Ports,
and the Dynamic and/or Private Ports. The well known ports are those from 0 through
1023, registered ports are those from 1024 through 49151 and the Dynamic and/or
Private Ports are those from 49152 through 65535.
